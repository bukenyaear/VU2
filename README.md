[TO BE ASSESSED OUT OF 5MARKS]
Victoria University (VU) needs a program to calculate how much to pay their hourly
employees. The HR Manual requires that employees get paid time and a half for any hours over
40 that they work in a single week.
For example, if Mr. Wakale Fazali, a Lecturer works 45 hours, He gets 5 hours of overtime, at
1.5 times their base pay. VU requires that hourly employees be paid at least UGX40,000 an
hour and an employee cannot work more than 60 hours in a week.
HINT
▪ An employee gets paid (hours worked) × (base pay), for each hour up to 40 hours.
▪ For every hour over 40, they get overtime = (base pay) × 1.5.
▪ The base pay must not be less than the minimum wage (UGX40,000 an hour) and if it
is, print an error. If the number of hours is greater than 60, print an error message.
REQUIREMENTS
1. Create a new class called VU.
2. Write a method that takes the base pay and hours worked as parameters, and prints the
total pay or an error. Write a main method that calls this method for each of these
employees.
Employees   Base Pay     Hours Worked
Employee A UGX28,000.00     35
Employee B UGX35,000.00     45
Employee C UGX38,000.00     75
